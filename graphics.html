                    <p>Cafe XM is an in-office cafe pop-up event I planned and hosted. The event had various cafe drinks and pastries for team mates to enjoy. 
                        This event was used to encourage team mates to unwind and have coffee chats at the end of Q4.

                        I was tasked with creating a welcoming flyer that advertised the event.

                    <p>Another event I helped host was the AAPI Hertiage Month Office Event. This event was used to celebrate and highlight the AAPI culture during the month of May. 
                        We catered food from local Asian business (Thai tea, samosas, egg rolls, sesame balls, etc). The event was an absolute hit!

                    <h2>VSA STICKERS</h2>
                    <p>Giving back always warms me up. As a board member for VSA, I wanted to come up with a creative way to spread awareness for Messengers of Love. 
                        Thus, I designed these stickers and sold them as a way to raise extra money for Messengers of Love while promoting VSA’s semesterly “Phofest.” 
                        My campaign proved to be successful as over 100 units were sold in under a week. It was rewarding seeing my designs make an impact on our community.
